    <h1>Copyright &copy; and trademark &#8482; </h1>
    <p>
        Copyright and trademark are both types of intellectual property rights (IPR) that give the owner exclusive rights to their work for a limited time. However, they have some key differences:
        <ul>
            <li><b>What they protect</b></li>
            <li><b>How they or obtained</b></li>
            <li><b>How Long they last</b></li>
            <li><b>What they protect</b></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
