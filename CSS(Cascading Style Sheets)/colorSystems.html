    <h1>What happens is not as important as how you react to what happens</h1>
    <h2>The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.</h2>
    <h3>The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.</h3>
    <h4>Just as treasures are uncovered from the earth, so virtue appears from good deeds, and wisdom appears from a pure and peaceful mind.</h4>
    <h5>Opportunities don't happen, you create them.</h5>
    <h6>Love your family, work super hard, live your passion.</h6>
