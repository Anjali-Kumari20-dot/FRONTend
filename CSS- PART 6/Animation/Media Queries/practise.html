            <h3>Meet Jerry</h3>
            <p>
                Jerry is a friendly and outgoing dog who
                loves making new friends - human and animal 
                alike! He's always up for an adventure, whether 
                it's a hike, a trip to the beach, or just a romp 
                around the backyard. Jerry is intelligent and curious, 
                always sniffing out new sights and smells.

            <h3>Meet Tom</h3>
            <p>
                Tom is a laid-back and easy-going cat who 
                loves to lounge around the house, napping 
                in sunbeams and pestering his humans for 
                snacks. He's a bit of a solitary creature,
                but he has a soft spot for belly rubs and
                will happily curl up in his favorite 
                human's lap for hours on end.
